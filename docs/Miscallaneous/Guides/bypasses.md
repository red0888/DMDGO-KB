# How to Bypass Beemo

In this guide, we will cover the method to bypass [Beemo](https://beemo.gg/). This is one of the more popular bots used by many NFT and Crypto servers.

#### Requirements

Now, assuming you have already bypassed server screening, you will need the following to bypass Beemo:

- Aged discord tokens (at least a few months old) which do not have the same registration date. For example, some tokens from March, some tokens from January, some tokens a year old at least.
- Tokens must have any avatar and bio.
- Tokens must be online with random status (Online/Idle/DND).

!!! info
    Based on information collected, most people seem to have most success at bypassing the bot with logged tokens.

#### Process

The process to bypass the bot is fairly straightforward.

- Go to invite joiner, and set threads to 1.
- If any, set additional verification bypass (if your server requires you to react to a message)
- Now the important thing - set base delay per thread to at least 7 to 10 minutes, that is 420 to 600 seconds **minimum.**
- Set random delay on top of base delay to at least 60-120 seconds.

and, voila! You have now bypassed the Beemo anti-raid system.

!!! warning 
    - Note that anti-raid bots have an ever changing algorithm and this method is **not guaranteed to work** always. While we do our best to update the guide with newer methods, it is best that you try your own settings based on the information given here.
    - Always make sure to use just **10 or 20 tokens** to test the correct settings before you attempt to join every token! Once Beemo deems a token to be a bot, the token is permanently banned across every single server that uses Beemo.
